********* Explanation of parameters:
Noise_level_in_measured_data: for removing noise in getting the first peak of cross-talk (or direct) signal
New_number_of_time_steps: add zeros to the end in order to make it consistent with simulations (Nt*dt = T)
Distance_of_propagation_in_z_direction: distance for data propagation
Upsampling_rate_in_time: reduce the time step by this factor. 
Distance_transmitter_to_object_for_inversion: In source shift, we move the data in time so that it corresponds to given positions of Tx and Rx
Distance_receiver_to_object_for_inversion: 	see above
Scaling_factor: this factor is equal to simulated data divived by measured data for a known object, to scale the measured data to the same magnitude as simulations	
Xmin_Xmax_dx_in_FDM_domain: 	FDM domain in simulation, the solution in homogeneous medium in this domain is used 
Ymin_Ymax_dy_in_FDM_domain: see above
Xmin_Xmax_dx_in_FEM_inversion_domain: FEM domain of inversion, data will be given in this domain for inversion
Ymin_Ymax_dy_in_FEM_inversion_domain: see above
Pseudo_frequency_s_min_s_max_ds: range of frequency used.
